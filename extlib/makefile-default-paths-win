#   makefile with the default locations for dependencies for Windows OS      #

#   Input: in principle none, as the external libraries usually have some    #
#          absolute path; however, $(SMS++SDR) = the directory where the     #
#          core SMS++ source is should always be available (this is assumed  #
#          to be included by $(SMS++SDR)/lib/makefile-c where the value must #
#          be defined) in case some of the external libraries happen to      #
#          rather be located at a relative path from there.                  #
#                                                                            #
#   Output: whatever macro is required by the external libraries makefiles,  #
#           to be found in $(SMS++SDR)/../extlib.                            #
#                                                                            #
#   The usefulness of packing all these definitions here lies in the fact    #
#   that one can then copy this file into                                    #
#                                                                            #
#        $(SMS++SDR)/../extlib/makefile-paths                                #
#                                                                            #
#   and change in there any path that is not in the default location that    #
#   this file specifies. Hopefully it should be enough to edit this one file #
#   to obtain a working installation, both for makefile (save minor issues   #
#   like compiler options) and Cmake, for the whole of the SMS++ project.    #
#   The point is that makefile-paths file is .gitignore-d. Hence, it should  #
#   not be necessary to re-change the makefiles (or stash/restore the        #
#   changes) each time parts of the project are pulled, or manually ignore   #
#   the changes when they are pushed, which is very convenient for anyone    #
#   who actually develops SMS++ components (and if you don't, you perhaps    #
#   should; think of it).                                                    #
#                                                                            #
